South China Sea example, following:

Z. Zhang, O. B. Fringer, and S. R. Ramp, 2011, "Three-dimensional,
nonhydrostatic numerical simulation of nonlinear internal wave
generation and propagation in the South China Sea", J. Geophys. Res.,
116, C05022.

The tidal boundary condition files are in tide_bc_files with either 1 or 
15 processors.

To run with a different number of processors, the files need to be recreated
as follows:

1) run the test case with "make test" 
2) An error will result saying that the tidecomponent.dat.* files do not 
exist.  
3) To create these files: 
3a) copy the tidexy.dat.* files to mfiles/data 
3b) run the mfiles/tides.m mfile (Note that you must run "make -C mfiles" 
in order to unzip the necessary files there and to run the mfile.)  
3c) copy the mfiles/data/tidecomponents.dat.* files back to rundata/.
