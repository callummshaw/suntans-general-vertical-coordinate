process in sunplot.c:     

11/17/12    finish all the change about nfaces. Add nfaces and maxfaces in ReadData.
         questions in Drawedgelines.
         looking for some error using 3*i not NFACES.

1/5/13   find bug in Readdata. it cannot load into quad grid
         fixed
1/6/13   find bug in Drawedgeline 

1/7/13   find bug in Unsurf->Fill 
         fix it!

2/4/13   find bug in reading data from multiple processor

3/10/13 add 2 buttons for CdT and CdB
        CdT and CdB are allocated at the center of edge, should plot in the center of cell -> we should do an intepolation
        readdata: read into cdt and cdb data into *data
                  use fopen here not MYopen
        change: mydraw

pay attention 1130line


4/8/13 for original examples. we need to change suntans.dat and run them again to show in sunplot with z0b.dat and z0t.dat

4/9/13 add CdV button to show the max CdV along the depth, CdV=0 means there is no marsh, CdV can be different for different types of vegetation
       Here only assume CdV is constant with time, because there is no difference when water go over marsh part.
       Finish here, not test yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  finished!
4/10/13 remember to change NUMBUTTONS after make a change!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

4/12/13 add hmarsh button to show the distribution of hmarsh in the calculation domain

07/05/2013 change sunplot will not load sedi marsh file when marshmodel=0 sedi=0

07/05/2013 make sure maxFaces>3 for new sunplot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

22/10/2013 make sunplot can work without maxfaces value in suntans.dat
           if maxfaces==0 maxface=3
06/12/2013 new bug for allsedic when with more than one sediment type to make allsedic=2*EMPTY=2000000; 


12/08/2013 delete SEDIFILE and change data->sedi=prop->computeSediments


04/14/2014 add new wave module part, Winds, Windd, Waveub, Waveh, keep the fetch model 

05/13/2014 delete tbmax
