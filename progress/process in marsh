07/03/2013 seperate marsh part out from phys.c
1. create new marsh.h and marsh.c
2. add freemarsh outputmarsh readmarshproperties allocatemarsh
3. change makefile in 'main' folder
4. add marsh.dat

08/07/2013
1. add limit for maxcdv and maxhmarsh to prevent hmarsh and CdV out of limit

09/06/2013

10/10/2014
change the marsh structure, 
1. move it into phys.c from suntans.c
2. change data structure to *marsh->
3. add new function initialize.c for hmarsh and cdv
4. delete other unuseful function

05/03/2015
1. for 1D model stop use marsh momentum term in momentum equation, use CdV_total

05/06/2015
