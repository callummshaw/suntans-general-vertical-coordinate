5/27 copy wave.c and wave.h into suntanshybrid version start to change not finished!

09/26 create simple wave model by calculating fetch of each cell (new model added in the future)
add wavemodel in suntans.dat and propT, readproperties
add WAVEFILE in suntans.dat and suntans.h and readfilenames in grid.c
add default wavemodel value in default.h and fielo.c

1. create wave.h, and set up parameters
   variable:
             Hwsig, Twsig, Winddir, Uwind, Fetch, Fw, 
   switch: 
             wavemodel(in PropT), fetchmodel, windconstant
   input: rough boundary if use fetch model
   
   output: new erosion calculation for wavemodel and hwsig and Twsig output every time step 
 
2. create wave.c
   ReadWaveProperties;
   AllocateWaveVariable;
   InitializeWaveVariable;
   FreeWaveVariable;
   CalculateFetch;
   CalculateHsigandTsig;
   CalculateFw;
   
3. modify boundary.c 
   add WindFieldFunction;

09/29 finish wave.c wave.h wave.dat
      modify phys.c suntans.c
      add WindSpeedandDirection function in Boundaries.c
      no test right now.

09/30 find bug in CalculateWaveexcur fixed use fabs!!!!!!!!!!!

10/1 find new bug in CalculateWaveexcur value incorrect -> Fw incorrect fixed 
     there is another error for fetch
      
04/08 add UpdateWave
      add Yi-Ju's model, stop at line853
      add updatewavefw and updatewavecr function used in sediments.c
      delete all use of sediT and spropT
      delete phys->de in obtainedgeKfield
      add phys->dhdt in main
      add blowup for updatewave function
      add isendrecvedgedata2d in sendrecv.c
      change openwavefiles and outputwavedata with the functionality to mergearray 
      add merge in openwavefiles
05/10 make sure Dmax in windfield is big enough
