2015/09/01 change scalar.c to work with subgrid module 
      add alpha to account different area effect 

2016/12/09 start the modification of UpdateScalar function
1. first modify it into new implicit schemes
2. modify the HorizontalFaceScalars function in tvd.c for the new implicit schemes

2016/12/10
1. add s_old T_old qt_old lt_old to store n-1 values
2. not finished! for sediments for modification is required for the sedimentSource
3. change UpdateScalarTransport function add one more input scal_old
4. modify the src1 option for updatescalar function
5. should decide which way is used for vertical momentum advection
(w\phi)^im=w^im\phi^im or still (w\phi)^im which needs to modify more for the input
6. all source term is set to dzz not dzzold at all as approximation

2017/02/01 
1. fix a bug for the flux direction when tvd scheme is used 
should use u_im not u_old (line 410)
