1/11/2012 corrected Function GetGrid(all finished except Partition outputdata);
          Function Freegrid is finished. Readgrid is not finished(should get the nfaces array from celldata.)
          start to change partition function
          stop at topology

2/11/2012 finish: topology and transferdata, EdgeMarkers, GeoMetery, VertGrid(not needed to change)
	  stop at Reorder

3/11/2012 finish: ReorderRealArray, ReorderIntArray in util.c
	  finish: ReOrder
	  finish: Partition
	  finish: CorrectVoronoi
          finish: OutPutData
	  Finish: ReadMainGrid

8/11/2012 transfer maxfaces in suntans.dat
	  Finish: suntan.dat
	  Finish: defaults.h
	  Finish: fielo.c
	  start: debug first
	  correct: ReadNfaces and Initmaingrid to make check maxFaces in Suntans.dat
	  suntans can compile;

9/11/2012 update to newest version of suntans
	  finish: util.c grid.c 
15/2/2013 make sure when maxface>3 never use CorrectVoronoi.







            change it to only correct triangle grid


10/11/2012 find a new problem in Partition fixed!!!!
           LIMIT:  IN GETAREA: ONLY FOR 3 AND 4 EDGES GRIDS        find error in  CreateMomentumCV(*localgrid) fixed!!!!!!!!

14/11/2012 update OutPutdata 
                  make celldatabackup.dat and cellbackup.dat without nfaces when maxfaces is 3 to test the codes
           changes: suntans.dat 
                    ReadFileNames in grid.c
15/11/2012 New BUG for OutPutData when maxfaces is 4 while using the same data
           fix it by deleting the changes in backup data
1/4/2013   fix bug in voronoistats to make it calculate correctly when grad[2n]==-1
           quad data for neigh should be clockwise or counter-clockwise for each cell
           fix it by quadgrid.m
1/5/2013   new bug in Geometry in calculate xe ye
           fix it , make it can calculate when grad[2n]==-1
1/6/2013   find new bug in createfacearray in gradf
           find new bug in connectivity for cells for the last cell ===> bug in reordercellspoints
           fixit by reorderfacearray!
           add Reordergradf
2/20/2013  not use ReadNfaces when -t is used
           in Initmaingrid function
           when -t maxfaces is set to be 3, nfaces is set to be 3, in phys.c interp and prettyplot can be 1. 

2/25/2013  change GetArea to use for any polygon with any number of edges. Edge index should be in the consequentive order.

07/04/2013 find bug in outputdata, for TRIANGLE==1, the output cell.dat is not right fixed!

07/28/2013 comment out codes for Actotal, never use interp==1 grid.h not changed if comment actotal in grid.h will have segmentation fault

08/05/2013 make actotal can work with interp==1 same as in phys.c

08/06/2013 add outvwgt in suntans.dat to output vwgt for each cell to check parmetis
           add outvwgt in fielo.c and defaults.h
           add VWGTFILE in suntans.h
           add output vwgt process in GetDepth functions

08/06/2013 some error in GetNk finished
           change it into a new version to consider when localdepth<dz[]

09/03/2013 prepare for 8-point interpolation for quad grid 
           line 3802

09/27/2013 add fclose(ifile) in ReadNfaces function


10/14/2013 find new bug in pcneigh numpcneigh to calculate Node.dat 
           works well with one proc, but error occurs when use multiplecores

10/15/2013 change outputdata only output useful node with numpcneighs!=0 if numpcneighs==0 output n and xp yp only

10/15/2013 make grid compatible with tri grid
           change readmaingrid function 
           no use Readnfaces when maxfaces==3
           set nfaces=3 for all cells
           reordercellpoints add maxfaces=3 when no sharednode

10/30/2013 fix bug in CorrectVoronoi function

12/9/2013 delete file name for SEDIFILE

12/21/2013 delete CULVERTFILE

12/24/2013 find error in geomery out of memory due to the assumption that localgrid->Np=maingrid->Np when interp=1 so Actotal=Np*Nkp*numprocs

05/08/2014 change createfacearray to make sure no strange happens when triangle has quad neighbours

10/08/2015 
change the function Interpdepth when subgrid is on. To make sure grid->dv=dmax within the cell to avoid error in horizonal momentum advection

05/20/2016
bug found in createFacearray function when 1 cell has two wall boundaries
