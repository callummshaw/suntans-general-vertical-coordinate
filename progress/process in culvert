1. add culvert.c culvert.h culvert.dat 
           for culvert simulations
2. add CULVERTFILE in suntans.h and change ReadFilenames in grid.c 

3. add culvertmodel in propT change fielo.c phys.c phys.h default.h

4. change CGSolve function to add CulvertHCoefficients function

5. change Upredictor to add check condition steps

6. change Updatedz add culvertmodel==1 condition


10/07/2013 
1. find bug in CulvertHCoefficients 
10/10/2013
   fixed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
   the only approximation is when 0->1 partial -> fully
   assume dt1=dt

10/23/2013 
1. add function CulvertIteration to calculate source term for free surface equation
2. change CulvertHCoefficient

12/23/2013
1. create culvert structure
2. create CalculateCulvertPressure function to include all the process in culvertmodel
3. bug error in SetCulvertDragCoefficient
4. delete culvert.dat merge into suntans.dat


10/11/2014
change culvert model data stucture set culvert->
add setupculvertmodel function

04/07/2014
1. use casulli's method for h(n)<culverttop, and h(n+1)>culverttop, after this time step, use 2. 
2. use sum(u*dz)=0 to solve after the time step for partially discharge to fully discharge

06/02/2014
1. add new wetting and drying method 
2. change CulvertHcoefficient and CulvertSource method and CulvertCondition function


08/15/2014 
1. add functionality with hiter
2. add functionality with subgrid

09/03/2014
1. assume water free surface cannot drop from culverttop to bottom.
2. be careful when you use hiter

09/18/2014
1. change the check convergence method for culvert model with subgrid 
2. add nested method into all the culvert model
   add culvertpressure2 to store h value for outer iteration
   the value of inner iteration is stored in phys->h
3. add CulvertUpdateQcoef function to update outer iteration coef
4. add SubgridCulverttopArea in subgrid.c to store culvert top wet area for culvert part

1. bug found!
   when initial condition is h[all]=1.0 culverttop[all]=-0.8, and with all closed b.c. 
   we cannot get the constant h results
   because the matrix for coef and fcoef is singular
   which is reasonable we cannot solve a pressure based on the volume conservation when pressure is uncoupled with volume

10/01/2014
1. bug found! 
   when subgrid
   htmp=veff-sum*dt, here veff=ac*(dv+h), should substract the volume beyond culverttop because Veff here is the effective volume, not v1 in iteration
2. still have problem when water from blow increases to the culverttop
   solve with use Veffold and culvertpressure in CulvertSource function!
3. bug found!
   with culvert, set h=culverttop if(h>culverttop) and then update dz and setfluxheight
4. change the condition of Culvertpressure>top && h>top to h_prev >top && h>top (still questionable)

10/03/2014
other option for culvert, try to use 1. culvert flux function
                            2. two cells in culvert part

10/18/2015
move Setculverdragcoefficient after storeculvertpressure in phys.c
the old location doesn't include the top drag from culvert
