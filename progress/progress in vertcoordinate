12/03/2016:
1. add new file vertcoordinate.c vertcoordinate.h for all the basic functions for the new general vertical coordinate
2. add uservertcoordinate.c uservertcoordinate.h include all functions for user-defined verticall coordinate
12/04/2016:
basic functions have been added
12/05/2016:
1. add vertcoordinatebasic function
2. problem with initialize omega/ density field
3. allocate phys.c and grid.c to make sure
  grid.c decide Nk -> all Nk[i]=Nkmax
  etop and ctop=0 forever
  use initialize vertical coordinate for different coordindates after setting the initial value of free surface
  all the initial function is in userdefinedverticalcoordinate.c
4. Modify the initializephysicalvariable function to add the initialization of the new vertical coordinate variable
5. add output files for dzz zc and omega
12/06/2016:
1. add a test case for vert-test
2. fix several bugs for the initial setup of the general vertical coordinate
12/07/2016:
Problems found: if solved will add (solved), if not all need to be solved
1. how to setup drag coefficient if dzf(Nke-1)<Bufferheight while total height>bufferheight. 
solution: can adjust bottom layer to make sure dzf>4z0 how ever will ruin the coordinate (although just a little since 4z0 is very small)
if hf<buffer height, cd is set as 100
12/08/2016
1. finish the change of Horizontalsource
add slope term for baroclinic pressure
divide horizontal momentum advection into two parts
the horizontal diffusion term is the same as the original method
12/09/2016
1. add new variables omega_old omega_old2 to store the old values of omega
2. modify the LayerAveragedContinuity function to calculate omega
3. adjust the location of ComputeZc function and put it directly after UpdateLayerthickness
4. Modify the UpdateScalars Function

12/10/2016
1. add omega_im=fac1*omega+fac2*omega^n+fac3*omega^n-1 for updatescalar function first wpredictor function
2. add dvdy dudx in vertcoordinate.c to calculate momentum advection
12/12/2016
1. add computeUl function seperated from computeuf function
2. add computezf function to calculate vertical location for each edge face center

12/16/2016
1. add two new variables Nkeb and zfb for setting drag coefficient
2. add FindBottomLayer function to calculate Nkeb and zfb for each edge
3. move setdragcoefficient after the drag forcing
4. top drag forcing is not finished!!!!!!!!!!! need to setup zft and find a way to implement surface stress


12/19/2016
1. a bug found in the ComputeCellAveragedGradient function to set the ne values before the calculation.
2. a bug found in calculation of dzdx and dzdy.

01/09/2017
1. add new variable and function to calculate cell center gradient
2. find bug in computeQsource and computecellcenteredgradient fixed
3. find efficiency problem by increasing computation time by 1/3 
   it's basically caused by the horizontalsource function and other additional functions 
4. new edits need to change in UpdateLayerthickness function

01/10/2017
1. a bug found in Wpredictor when nonlinear==0 the additional advection part should be turned off
2. add a case vertcoord=5 which is a z-level duplicate with the new general vertical coordinate to solve the equation
it can be applied to test the codes to compare the original z-level codes when vertcoord=1

01/11/2017
1. for the vertcoord=5 if want to be exactly like z-level: computeomega should delete udzdx and vdzdy
2.

01/12/2017
1. add U3 for store w-udzdx-vdzdy
2. change the way to calculate qsource, avoid use omega for qsource and use U3 instead
3. update the manual (not finished!)

01/16/2017
1. still needs problem for the wetting and drying for isopycnal model
for the drying of interior layer

01/18/2017
the isopycnal layer needs addition treatment for wetting and drying :
1. need to use u^im to calculate upwind dzf to ensure no drying when Courant No<1
2. need to ensure dzdx is small enough for the mild slop approximation
3. even with modify dzf, the large dzdx will still blow up the model!

02/02/2017
1. add lines to setup dzzold^0=dzz^initial in the initializelayerthickness function

02/04/2017
1. add the monitor function to calculate variation approach in uservercoordinate.c
2. add vert->M to store the monitor value for variational approach

02/05/2017
1. lockexchange test has been tested with both nonconservative and conservative advection
2. for conservative method, the flow is not stable with nonlinear=2 (central differencing) and 4 (lax wendroff)
3. need more discussion on the monitor function (whether to solve the exact function) and advection scheme.
