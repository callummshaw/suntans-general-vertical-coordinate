12/03/2016:
1. add new file vertcoordinate.c vertcoordinate.h for all the basic functions for the new general vertical coordinate
2. add uservertcoordinate.c uservertcoordinate.h include all functions for user-defined verticall coordinate
12/04/2016:
basic functions have been added
12/05/2016:
1. add vertcoordinatebasic function
2. problem with initialize omega/ density field
3. allocate phys.c and grid.c to make sure
  grid.c decide Nk -> all Nk[i]=Nkmax
  etop and ctop=0 forever
  use initialize vertical coordinate for different coordindates after setting the initial value of free surface
  all the initial function is in userdefinedverticalcoordinate.c
4. Modify the initializephysicalvariable function to add the initialization of the new vertical coordinate variable
5. add output files for dzz zc and omega
12/06/2016:
1. add a test case for vert-test
2. fix several bugs for the initial setup of the general vertical coordinate
12/07/2016:
Problems found: if solved will add (solved), if not all need to be solved
1. how to setup drag coefficient if dzf(Nke-1)<Bufferheight while total height>bufferheight. 
solution: can adjust bottom layer to make sure dzf>4z0 how ever will ruin the coordinate (although just a little since 4z0 is very small)
if hf<buffer height, cd is set as 100
2.
